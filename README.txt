Game window is changed to 1280x680 pixels since the screen resolution on my computer is less than expected (1280x800 pixels).

Clarification on the approach of Keyboard shortcuts R, Q:
R:
When R is typed on keyboard, the snake game will go back to the splash screen. However, it will not reset the position of the snake.
When you start the game again from the splash screen (without closing the game window/terminating te program), 
the position of snake is the same as when the user switch to the splash screen.

Q:
Once the user is at final score screen, the user is unable to use any of the keyboards shortcuts. (i.e. even if the user type 'R', 
the game will not reset to the splash screen. The user must close the program and restart it again.)

The program will not return even if the final screen is shown. The user has to manually close/terminate the program.
